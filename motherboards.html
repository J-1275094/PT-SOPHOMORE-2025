            <h2>Motherboards</h2>
            <p>A motherboard (also called system board, logic board, or mainboard) is a circuit board that either houses, or connects to, all components operating in the computer.</p>

            <h3>Motherboard Specs</h3>
            <p>When selecting a motherboard, consider the following motherboard specifications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU) socket type</li>
                <li>Memory module compatibility</li>
                <li>Number of memory slots</li>
                <li>Maximum supported memory</li>
                <li>Expansion slot count and type</li>
                <li>Onboard devices (video, audio, or network)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Typical Components</h3>
            <p>A typical motherboard includes the following components:</p>
            <div class="table">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell"><strong>Component</strong></div>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">CPU socket</div>
                    <div class="cell">The CPU socket houses the CPU. Different types of motherboard sockets exist to fit different generations of CPUs. It's important that the socket is compatible with the new CPU's mounting holes and pin array.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Memory slots</div>
                    <div class="cell">Most motherboards have multiple slots to add memory cards. Memory slots are compatible with a specific type of memory module.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">PCI</div>
                    <div class="cell">PCI slots are often called expansion slots. They allow you to add cards to expand the capabilities of a computer by installing expansion cards.</div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Integrated components</div>
                    <div class="cell">Many motherboards include integrated components such as network cards, audio cards, and video cards. They can also include USB and FireWire connections.</div>

            <h3>Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure your motherboard is compatible with the CPU socket type and memory module type.</li>
                <li>Check that your motherboard has enough PCI slots for your expansion cards.</li>
                <li>Verify that the onboard devices (video, audio, network) are functioning properly.</li>
                <li>Make sure your motherboard's firmware (BIOS/UEFI) is updated to support your hardware.</li>
            </ul>

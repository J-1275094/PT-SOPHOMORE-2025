            <h2>Expansion Bus Types</h2>
            <p>This lesson covers expansion bus types. Expansion cards expand a computer's functionality or increase its performance. Expansion cards install into the expansion slot on a motherboard. Expansion bus standards define communication specifications as well as physical characteristics of expansion cards and slots.</p>

            <h3>Common Expansion Bus Types</h3>
            <p>The following table describes the characteristics of the most common expansion bus types.</p>
            
            <div class="table">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell"><strong>Bus Type</strong></div>

                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)</div>
                    <div class="cell">PCI was developed to replace the obsolete ISA and VESA bus standards. PCI is processor independent, supports plug-and-play, and is commonly used by devices such as sound cards, network cards, and storage device controllers. PCI runs at 33 MHz (133 MBps) or 66 MHz (266 MBps).</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">PCI Express (PCIe)</div>
                    <div class="cell">PCIe was developed to replace PCI, PCI-X, and AGP. PCIe uses a serial, full-duplex transmission method with several connection types, defined by the number of transmission lanes (x1, x4, x8, x16, x32). Data rates vary depending on the protocol version and lanes used.</div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Legacy Buses</div>
                    <div class="cell">Buses that have been replaced by newer types are considered legacy. Examples include AGP, Audio/modem riser (AMR), and Communications network riser (CNR).</div>

            <h3>Video Cards</h3>
            <p>Video cards process graphical information for output to an external display. The quality and speed have increased dramatically with PC gaming and cryptocurrency mining. A device called a capture card is growing in use to support streaming and recording games and videos.</p>
            
            <h4>Integrated vs. Dedicated Video Cards</h4>
            <p>You can implement video cards as a dedicated expansion board or integrated with other components.</p>
            
            <h5>Integrated Video Cards:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Integrate the GPU with another hardware component (e.g., the CPU or motherboard).</li>
                <li>Share system memory for graphic processing.</li>
                <li>Are less expensive but less powerful.</li>
                <li>Are found in most pre-built PCs and laptops.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Dedicated Video Cards:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Installed in an expansion slot on the motherboard.</li>
                <li>Have a dedicated GPU and memory bank.</li>
                <li>More powerful but more expensive.</li>
                <li>Used in cryptocurrency mining.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Characteristics of Video Cards</h4>

            <h3>Processor Considerations</h3>
            <p>The following table lists key factors to consider when choosing a processor for your system.</p>
            
            <div class="table">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell"><strong>Condition</strong></div>
                    <div class="cell"><strong>Description</strong></div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">CPU Manufacturer</div>
                    <div class="cell">Intel and AMD are the two major producers of processors used in modern PCs. Intel has a larger market share, while AMD processors are typically more cost-effective.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">32-bit or 64-bit</div>
                    <div class="cell">64-bit processors can handle more memory (up to 16 EB) than 32-bit processors, which are limited to 4GB. Operating systems and applications must be designed for 64-bit CPUs to take full advantage of them.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Multi-core</div>
                    <div class="cell">Multi-core processors have multiple cores within a single package, enabling better multitasking and performance. Common options are dual-core, triple-core, and quad-core.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Speed</div>
                    <div class="cell">Processor speed is measured in megahertz (MHz), and the operating frequency is linked to the motherboard's bus speed. Ensure compatibility between processor speed and motherboard support.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Cache</div>
                    <div class="cell">Cache memory (L1, L2, L3, L4) enables the processor to access data more quickly than system RAM. Larger cache typically improves processor performance.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Process Size</div>
                    <div class="cell">A smaller process size (measured in microns or nanometers) leads to smaller transistors, better performance, and lower power consumption in CPUs.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Hyper-threading</div>
                    <div class="cell">Hyper-threading, available on some Intel processors, allows a single processor to handle two threads simultaneously, improving multitasking.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Throttling</div>
                    <div class="cell">Throttling adjusts the processor's speed to conserve power or reduce heat output, especially in mobile systems.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Overclocking</div>
                    <div class="cell">Overclocking pushes the processor beyond its rated specifications for higher performance but can reduce its lifespan and void warranties.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Mobile Processors</div>
                    <div class="cell">Mobile CPUs are designed for mobile devices, focusing on minimizing power consumption and heat generation.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Virtualization</div>
                    <div class="cell">Virtualization allows running multiple operating systems simultaneously on a single machine. It requires processors with specific features like Intel's VT or AMD-V.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Integrated Memory Controller</div>
                    <div class="cell">Some processors have an integrated memory controller that improves performance by reducing the time it takes for data to travel between the CPU and memory.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="cell">Cooling</div>
                    <div class="cell">CPUs require cooling systems to prevent overheating. Methods include heat sinks, fans, thermal paste, and liquid cooling systems.</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Troubleshooting and Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the CPU is compatible with the motherboard before installation.</li>
                <li>Check for BIOS/UEFI updates to ensure processor compatibility and performance.</li>
                <li>Consider using thermal paste and appropriate cooling systems to prevent CPU overheating.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the risks of overclocking, including potential damage and voiding warranties.</li>
